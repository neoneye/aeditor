02-june-2004 Neoneye
*	version 0.8 released.

23-may-2004 Neoneye
*	moved DecodeUTF16 and File classes into 'iterator.rb'.

22-may-2004 Neoneye
*	UTF16 decoder can now both go forward and backward, and
	can do both big and little endian.

21-may-2004 Neoneye
*	Iterator::File.clone, Nobu Nokada wrote a patch to 'io.c' 
	so that File.dup now is working correct on FreeBSD. The 
	position-garbage problem seems only to occur on FreeBSD, 
	other platforms Linux, Windows seems to work ok.

20-may-2004 Neoneye
*	wrote an experimental Iterator::File.. must find a more
	clean way to do #clone of it.
*	preparations for UTF16 decoder.

18-may-2004 Neoneye
*	transfered the UTF8 decoder I recently have been working on
	from my regexp project to this iterator project. Wrote some
	rdoc documentation on how to use it.

06-may-2004 Neoneye
*	versioin 0.7 released.

05-may-2004 Neoneye
*	Reverse wasn't able to #clone itself correct, this is fixed now.
*	Got rid of #position_prev, which was offbyone in conjunction
	with Reverse. It should be even more robust now.
*	Fixed bug in ProxyLast#reverse where a bordercase wasn't 
	being considered. This is now fixed.
*	bound-check added to Collection#current.
*	ProxyLast#reverse now toggles the reversal in case one
	tries to reverse it more than one time.

03-may-2004 Neoneye
*	preparing to make ProxyLast reversable.. more tweaking needed.

27-april-2004 Neoneye
*	Iterator::Base now includes Comparable module, so
	that we can sort, compare.. do nice things.

14-april-2004 Neoneye
*	to_a not necessary in 'sample/multiway3.rb' because it
	uses continuations.
*	Added 'post-install.rb' which outputs a notice about
	that users are encouraged to send feedback.

07-april-2004 Neoneye
*	versioin 0.6 released.
*	minimal rdoc'ification of 'iterator.rb'.
	http://aeditor.rubyforge.org/iterator/

29-march-2004 Neoneye
*	ProxyLast failed to compare against other instances.
*	Had forgotten to do 'self.class.new' in ProxyLast#clone,
	so that derived classes failed being cloned correct.

20-march-2004 Neoneye
*	version 0.5 released as: gem, tgz, zip.
*	early experiments with packaging this as a rubygem.
*	reworked the file-release system, so that I can make
	multiple distributions. A rubygem package doesn't 
	require 'install.rb' nor 'MANIFEST'. 
	However a tarball does require it.

23-febuary-2004 Neoneye
*	version 0.4 released.
*	added ProxyLast class; it remembers the last visited value.
*	Iterator::VERSION constant added.

02-december-2003 Neoneye
*	version 0.3 released.

01-december-2003 Neoneye
*	Range class now supports has_next?/has_prev?
	it didn't #close its iterators correct.. fixed now.
*	Now all iterator classes supports #has_next?
	and there are no longer any traces of #is_done? left.
*	I consider it as good practize to let #first/#last
	return 'self'.
*	all samples has been adopted to use #has_next?
*	Added 'sample/concat1.rb' which demonstrates Iterator::Concat.
*	wrote inline-RDoc-documentation fore: Base, Algorithm, Array.

30-november-2003 Neoneye
*	#+ and #- are dangerous, in some cases when doing 
	selfassignment x+=3, the cloned instance will get 
	lost. Therefore I have replaced them with #next(n) and #prev(n).

24-november-2003 Neoneye
*	version 0.2 released.
*	Added 'sample/implicit2.rb' which demonstrates #copy_n.
*	Added 'sample/filler1.rb' which demonstrates #fill.
*	Added 'sample/transformer1.rb' which demonstrates #transform.

23-november-2003 Neoneye
*	Added Collection#==(other).

21-november-2003 Neoneye
*	Added #+ and #- to Iterator::Base.
*	Added #copy, #copy_n and #copy_backward to Object/Array.
*	Added #create_iterator_end to Array. I think last element
	should be excluded from the range spanned by i1..i2.
*	Iterator::Continuation#clone is now working.
*	#transform, #fill are now added.

20-november-2003 Neoneye
*	version 0.1 released.
