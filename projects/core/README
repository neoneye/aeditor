What is Aeditor ?
=================

AEditor is a programmers editor for unix. It relies on Ncurses.
Its capable of: Folding, blocking, Macros, Undo/Redo...etc.
There is a huge testsuite (415 tests), so it should be stable.
However it lacks some things and consumes lots of memory. 
Its written entirely in Ruby, so the code should be very easy
to grasp and extend, kind of Emacs with Ruby.


Future plans
============

AEditor is a rival to scintilla. It is meant to be
embedded into other applications, eg: FreeRIDE.
AEditor aims at becoming the best tool for pair-programming.

I have done some experiments making GUI frontends for
foxtoolkit and qt. These are written in C++ and embeds the Ruby 
interpreter inside. This isn't my primary focus, if anyone wants
to help then please do.

Because its written entirely in Ruby, there should be no
problems in making it fully scriptable in Ruby too. 
Imagine writing editor-macros in Ruby ;-)

My primary focus is to finish the regexp engine, so that
AEditor can get some nice syntax coloring. I want to use
perl6 regexp syntax everywhere in this project.

Ncurses Notes
=============

The only usable frontend for AEditor so far, is 
Ncurses (GUI frontends is in an experimental stage).

You migth want to set the $ESCDELAY environment variable,
in order to get instant response from the Escape key.
Ncurses defaults value is 1000 ms... too long, I would say.
Therefore:   setenv ESCDELAY 100
On certain terminals (xterm). If you set the value too low, 
you may get trouble reading the status of the arrow-keys!


Mac Notes
=================

[15-Sep-2003]
I visited my friend Johan Gade which uses MacosX, we 
installed Ruby + ruby-ncurses + AEditor. The termtype 
is 'dtterm' I never hear about this before. Ncurses
did not deal with the keybindings for F1-F4,
pageup/pagedown, home/end. I cannot do anything about
it, this is a Ncurses issue.

[10-Aug-2003]
Terminal.app & iTerm 0.7.0 doesn't like using the function keys.
iTerm 0.7.6 handles them just fine, see:
