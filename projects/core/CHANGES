01-april-2004 Neoneye
*	version 0.12 is released.
*	updated README, INSTALL.
*	changed licence from BSD to Ruby's.
*	Converted tests from RUnit to Test::Unit.
*	Made some warnings go away because I used deprecated
	features. 

16-september-2003 Neoneye
*	INSTALL was refering to 'ncurses-ruby' using
	the confusing 'ncurses' name. People will think
	it is Ncurses that I am refering to.. Which it
	is NOT. Also guide to how to uninstall AEditor
	has been added. [Johan Gade's suggestion]

27-august-2003 Neoneye
*	moved 'backend/cmdline.rb' to 'ncurses/cmdline.rb'.
*	the last week I have been playing with DocBook
	and 'catalog.xml'. I have started both a user-
	and a developer-manual project.

18-august-2003 Neoneye
*	change directory hierarchy, so that frontend is
	seperated from backend.
*	merged 'markers1' branch. Could not initiate the
	work with markers, because of the limited 
	keybinding system. Thus the last week I have spend
	parsing wierd escape sequences from the keyboard,
	now I just have to integrate it into AEditor.
	When integration is completed, I will hopefully
	be able to Insert, Remove, Goto markers.

12-august-2003 Neoneye
*	version 0.11 is released.
*	At the bottom of file: the empty lines is rendered
	with black background (nice). Earlier it rendered 
	'yyy' for debugging purposes (annoying).
*	expand_fold now scans the whole line, this is
	much more user-friendly. Earlier the cursor
	had to be located right above the fold (annoying).

11-august-2003 Neoneye
*	fixed: macroes now invoke #execute_redo when 
	redoing, and use #execute at first invokation.
	Before when redoing it just invoked #execute,
	but this has bad consequences: pageup/down
	doesn't remember @height correctly, therefore
	pageup/down will cause problems in macros.
*	fixed, pagedown/up trashed the x position.
*	added F7+F8 to Ncurses menu.
*	fixed autoindent problem with empty lines.

08-august-2003 Neoneye
*	version 0.10 is released.
*	determine title when collapsing folds is working.
*	collapse fold is now working (press F8).
*	identify begin/end of fold.
*	Edit#scan_right(&block) is added.

07-august-2003 Neoneye
*	Commands::FoldExpand now raises CommandHarmless,
	so that the whole application doesn't terminate.
*	the percent indicator now reflects the number of
	visible lines. Better in conjunction with folding.
*	Edit::Fold didn't reflect the width of the fold
	instance (were hardcoded to 3). This caused the
	x position to screw. Fixed.

06-august-2003 Neoneye
*	F7 = expand fold.
*	Edit#unlink_fold! is implemented.

05-august-2003 Neoneye
*	F8 = insert fake fold.
*	we can now render the 2 types of folds we will
	become able to deal with: line-fold and scope-fold.

03-august-2003 Neoneye
*	rendering now uses Visitor instead of switch.

01-august-2003 Neoneye
*	merged 'pagedown_bottom' branch, which fixed the
	undo-behavier of pagedown at the buffer-bottom.

31-juli-2003 Neoneye
*	reworked the test system for Command::Pagedown, in
	order to adress offbyone problem, plus problem with
	virtual lines.

29-juli-2003 Neoneye
*	version 0.9 is released.
*	merged with branch 'notify_scope1'. Much refactoring
	has resulted in more robust and reliable undo/redo.
*	update display after playing a failing-macro were 
	insufficiently. This was before the CommandHarmless
	exception hierarchy were fully introduced. A fatal
	exception was emitted from a command contained within
	a macro. Nevertheless the screen should alway be 
	refreshed after playing a macro.

28-juli-2003 Neoneye
*	re-enabled Buffer#test_exception_xxx.
*	In case a command is not able to execute, then a
	CommandHarmless derived exception is thrown.
	This won't crash the application, only fatal exceptions
	is suppose to crash the application.

27-juli-2003 Neoneye
*	fixed: Commands::Pageup did not deal correct with
	top-of-buffer. When trying to undo the operation 
	scrolling got messed up. solution: lock the view!
*	refactoring: true/false returnvalues from commands
	indicating wheter or not there were modifications on
	the data. Has been replaced by an exceptions-system,
	if exception thrown then no modification occured.
	If it terminate successfully then, some kind of 
	modification to the data occured. This has improved
	robustness of commands a lot.
*	refactoring: notify_scope is now only invoked at 
	top-level (Control#execute). This has simplified all
	commands a bit.
*	version 0.8 is released.
*	bugfix: Edit::VSpace#move_left/right did not return
	true/false correctly trashing undo/redo completely.
*	fixed: Buffer#block_remove did do a #import_top instead
	of #import_bottom, which trashed screw completely.

26-juli-2003 Neoneye
*	made a general (dirty) comensate for screw mixin,
	it seems to behave wierd with BlockRemove, therefore
	do some unittesting of it.
*	investigated horizontal operations.
	http://aeditor.rubyforge.org/horizontal.html

25-juli-2003 Neoneye
*	transition from sourceforge to rubyforge. 

24-juli-2003 Neoneye
*	transition from sourceforge to rubyforge. 

22-juli-2003 Neoneye
*	fixed Buffer#set_memento, so that position-within-view
	is preserved.

21-juli-2003 Neoneye
*	version 0.7 is released.

20-juli-2003 Neoneye
*	TestCommandsMovement#test_pageup_xxx is passing OK.
	Thus Commands#MovePageup is now able to restore 
	scrolling, it even works after the window.resize!!!
*	bugfix in Buffer#resize_topbottom, import-bot fixed.
*	bugfix in Buffer#set_memento_position, scrolling fixed.

19-juli-2003 Neoneye
*	TestCommandsMovement#test_pagedown_xxx is passing OK.
	Thus Commands#MovePagedown is now able to restore 
	scrolling, it even works after the window.resize!!!
*	Command#execute_undo/redo is added.
*	Extracted Ncurses dependent code to 'frontend_ncurses.rb'

18-juli-2003 Neoneye
*	Merged Buffer#create_memento_variants into
	Buffer#create_memento(type).
	Merged Buffer#set_memento_variant into
	Buffer#set_memento(memento).
*	Earlier #create_memento returned an Array containing
	the state. Now its encapsulated within a class:
	Memento::All, ::Line, ::Position.

17-juli-2003 Neoneye
*	Buffer#move_page_up can now deal with 'height'.

16-juli-2003 Neoneye
*	Buffer#move_page_down can now deal with 'height'.

14-juli-2003 Neoneye
*	renamed Originator#get_state into #create_memento
	and #set_state into #set_memento.

11-juli-2003 Neoneye
*	version 0.6 is released.
*	implemented blocking: cut, copy, paste.
	See the cvs-branch 'blocking1'.
*	StateAll is now encapsulating the 'entire' state.
*	I had confused Buffer#position_visible_lines with
	Buffer#position_y. Not blocking is rendered OK.
*	This message is written in Aeditor itself!

10-juli-2003 Neoneye
*	Buffer#cmd_block_copy + paste is now able to deal
	correct with oneliners and autoindent.
*	bugfix: Edit#set_state did not #reset, therefore it
	keept accumulation data. Which is a really bad idea.

09-juli-2003 Neoneye
*	Buffer#cmd_block_paste is implemented.
*	Buffer#cmd_block_copy is implemented.
*	Buffer#cmd_block_remove is implemented.

07-juli-2003 Neoneye
*	version 0.5 is released.
*	Buffer#cmd_move_home: in case the cursor is located
	on an empty line, then it scans the lines above in
	order to determine the indentation level.

06-juli-2003 Neoneye
*	Edit#move_home is now able to toggle between
	indentation-point and begining of line.
*	auto-indent when issuing Buffer#cmd_breakline.
*	View#bottom_menu now fits to width of screen, plus
	shows if we are in record_mode.
*	refactoring of View, so its nolonger a flyweigth.
*	Found out that if the ESCDELAY env variable is
	assigned to a too low value (zero), then on certain
	terminals (xterm) pressing an arrow-key results
	in 'clean-exit'. Therefore ESCDELAY = 100.

05-juli-2003 Neoneye
*	Cellarea can now bind attributes to a color.
*	View#top_menu now fits to width of screen, plus
	shows the buffer.filename. It were static before.
*	full-snapshots for vertical operation is no longer
	necessary. Buffer#get/set_state_position is added.
*	version 0.4 is released
*	fixed: Buffer#get_state messed up the newlines.
*	fixed: Buffer#replace_content throwed a
	BufferBottom exception, if empty buffer supplied.
*	Buffer#file_save is implemented. 
	before writing to disk, it makes a backup ".bak".

04-juli-2003 Neoneye
*	fixed: import_bottom did not deal correctly with
	the last-line in the buffer. If the second-last-line
	were terminated with physical-newline, and the
	last-line were empty. Then it raised BufferBottom.
	Now it imports an empty line as its suppose to.

03-juli-2003 Neoneye
*	fixed: if no file2open were supplyed to aedtior
	then it simply crashed during startup.
*	fixed: on consoles without color, the script died.

02-juli-2003 Neoneye
*	version 0.3 is released
*	The Escape key is now terminating us more gently.
*	Nobu Nokada suggested that instead of hacking with
	rubys search path ($:[0]), that I instead prefixed
	require statements with 'aeditor'. Nice, tnx :-)
*	version 0.2 is released
*	no exceptions if pressing 'play' as the first thing.
*	the 'aeditor' binary is now able to locate main.
*	Ncurses::KEY_BACKSPACE binding to :do_backspace.
*	the log file is now generated in the temp dir.

01-juli-2003 Neoneye
*	version 0.1 is released
