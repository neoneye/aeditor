Keybindings
==================
This is the Ncurses-frontend for AEditor, its keybinding 
system is _very_ limited. Thus most operations is bound 
to the function keys (F1..F12). Fancy combinations like 
CTRL+C and SHIFT+ARROW_LEFT is NOT possible (yet). 


Exit
==================
Pressing <ESC> will immidiately quit AEditor.
TODO: buffer is not saved, do you really want to quit?


Save
==================
<F2> saves the file to disc. AEditor *never* overwrites
the original file; instead it appends '.bak' to the
original file before storing data to disc.


Cut, Copy, Paste
==================
Pressing <F3> toggles between block-mode and normal-mode.
First time you press <F3>, you will get into block-mode.
Second time you press <F3>, it will take a copy of the 
selected range and bring you back into normal-mode.

<F4> pastes the content of the clipboard at the cursors
current position.

<F5> destroyes the selected range.


Scrolling
==================
Pressing <F6> toggles between scroll-mode and normal-mode.
Scroll-mode changes the behavier of all movement-operations,
instead of moving the cursor, they move the window and
the cursor just follow.


Folding
==================
<F8> collapses a range of lines into a fold which only
takes up ONE line. You can choose the range by inserting
a begin-tag '#[' and a end-tag '#]'. The cursor can be
located on an arbitrary line between the begin-tag and 
end-tag.

<F7> expands a fold so that things get restored again.
The cursor must be located on the fold-tag. Otherwise
nothing happens.

You can supply a name to the fold, so that it is easier 
to recall what is contained within the fold, by simply 
letting a comment (test) follow the begin-tag.

  if true #[ test   \\  
    puts "hello"     >>   if true [ 2 test ]
  end #]            //


Macros
==================
Pressing <F9> toggles between macro-mode and normal-mode.
First time you press <F9>, AEditor will start recording
all succeding operations until you leave macro-mode.
Second time you press <F9>, it will take a copy of the
sequence of operations and place it in a macro, you 
will leave macro-mode.

<F10> plays the latest macro.


Multilevel Undo
==================
<CTRL-U> undoes the previous operation. 

<CTRL-R> redoes earlier undone operations. 


Movement
==================
<ARROW_UP> moves the cursor to the line above.

<ARROW_DOWN> moves the cursor to the line below.

<ARROW_LEFT> moves the cursor one unit to the left. 

<ARROW_RIGHT> moves the cursor one unit to the right. 

<PAGE_UP> moves one page up.

<PAGE_DOWN> moves one page down.

<HOME> toggles between the indentation-point and
the begining of line.

<END> moves to the end of line.


Editing
==================
<BACKSPACE> removes the letter to the left of the cursor.
If the cursor is at the begining of the line, it will
join the line with the line above.

<ENTER> insert newline at the cursor position, does 
autoindent.

<TAB> inserts a tabulator character.
