Prerequisites
=================

  1.   Ruby v1.8.0 or greater
       http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/
       if you already have Ruby installed, then you can
       validate its version number by issuing:
       prompt> ruby -v
       ruby 1.8.0 (2003-08-04) [i386-freebsd5.1]
       prompt> 

  2.   Ncurses-ruby v0.7.1 or greater
       http://raa.ruby-lang.org/list.rhtml?name=ncurses-ruby
       Unfortunatly there is no way to probe for its version 
       number, if you already have Ncurses-ruby installed. 
       The only way you can get its version number is by
       looking in the VERSION file in its tar.gz file!


Installation
=================

Follow these 3 steps in order to install.
last step may require 'root' permissions.

    ruby install.rb config
    ruby install.rb setup
    ruby install.rb install


In order to launch, just type 'aeditor' in a prompt.
If this doesn't work then do 'rehash' and try again.
If it still doesn't may want to check that Ruby is in 
your PATH.
