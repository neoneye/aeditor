<title>Customization and Presets</title>
<para>Its a black art to choose settings which is sensible.

<section>
<title>Key Bindings</title>
<para>I prefer using the F1-F12 keys for the most common operations.
</para>

<section>
<title>Execute BackwardForward</title>
<para>Many operations can be applied both forward and backwards on
the buffer, for instance search operations such as <command>jump-to-next-error</command>.
F8 = execute backwards. F9 = execute forwards.</para>

<para>Why did I choose these 2 keys, because they are easy to reach with the
right hand (Im righthanded). If I had chosen F10 or F11 I would have
to count number of keys. I believe <command>execute</command> is a very
important operation.</para>

<para>There is operations which you may wish to perform, again and again: 
<command>play-macro</command>,
<command>search</command>,
<command>replace</command>,
<command>goto-next-bookmark</command>,
<command>goto-next-error</command>.
We need a popup menu where we can choose among these operations, for instance F10.
When this popup is open and we continue pressing F10 then we can cycle through
the available operations. We hit ENTER to choose the operation and the window
closes.</para>

<section>
<title>Dotfile Per Project</title>
<para>Sometimes its necessary to follow your companys styleguide,
which describes: indentation, comment-style.
When these settings is different from your prefered style, 
then its useful to have a local configuration for that project.
