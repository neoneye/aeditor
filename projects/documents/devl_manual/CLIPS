The following is a quote of vruz. 
He tells me that its difficult for people to think of
something.. if they doesn't consider it to that hard.

<neoneye> vruz: ah.. excelent idea.. a regexp chapter.. hmm
<neoneye> vruz: why didn't I think of that?
<vruz> you are good at both of those things, one tends to take 
       for granted what doesn't represent a challenge
