<title>A broad overview</title>
<para>AEditor currently consists of 5 big sub-projects.
</para>
<para>The <productname>backend</productname> is the engine 
which drives the editor. It is heavily unit tested and entirely 
platform-independent.
</para>
<para>An <productname>regexp-engine</productname> to be used
for syntax coloring and advanced seaching. Its aiming towards 
being 99% compatible with the GNU-regexp engine that Ruby uses. 
Also perl6 syntax would be nice.
</para>
<para>The <productname>frontend(s)</productname> is the code 
which deals with input and output between human and backend. 
There can be several frontends, to name a few: Ncurses, GTK, OpenGL.
Frontends are highly platform-specific.
</para>
<para><productname>Language-bridge</productname>. Because 
frontends can be written in an entirely different language 
than the backend, there is need for a language-bridge. At the 
moment only Ruby-C++ has been explored. I doubt there is need 
for other language-bridges, but I should never say never.
</para>
<para>Analysis and thoughts on how things should be 
implemented. Thoughts on how operations should behave under
different conditions(undo/redo) in order to be most 
user-friendly.
</para>

<section>
<title>Goal, status, plan</title>
<para>The primary goal for AEditor is to make a highly
flexible core, which can be tweaked and customized.
I prioritize user-friendlyness of the operations very high,
because I have seem too many editor which is user-hostile.
The core will probably require some more iterations before I
feel satisfied with it. More secondary is GUI Frontends.
</para>
<para>The future plan is to do experiments with:
</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>multiple views.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>syntax hiliting.
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>unicode internal representation.
</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>
