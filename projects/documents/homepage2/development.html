<h1>Help Develop AEditor</h1>
<p>The vision for AEditor is to become a programming environment
suitable for pair-programming. This goal has not yet been reached.
Please consider joining the AEditor team to help accomplish this goal.</p>
<h1>Join Team</h1>
<p>First get yourself a 
[<a href="http://rubyforge.org/account/register.php">Rubyforge account</a>].
Second send a mail to the [<a href="mailto:neoneye@gmail.com">AEditor Author</a>]
and you will be added to this project. Third do a 
[<a href="http://rubyforge.org/scm/?group_id=18">cvs checkout</a>] 
and you are now in buisness.</p>
<h1>Join Mailing List</h1>
<p>There is still only little trafic. We talk about AEditor and its 
subprojects. Its relative easy to subscribe, just click on
[<a href="http://rubyforge.org/mailman/listinfo/aeditor-talk">Subscribe Here</a>]. Previous conversations can be found 
[<a href="http://rubyforge.org/pipermail/aeditor-talk/">here</a>].
</p>
<p>If you have interest in editor development then join this list, 
so ideas can be shared and great things can be accomplished.</p>
<h1>The Secret Plan</h1>
<p>The author of this project is analysing how AEditor version 2.x should 
be like. Here is an overview of his thoughs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nested Lexers.</li>
<li>Folding.</li>
<li>Better Caching.</li>
<li>i18n.</li>
</ul>
<p>The biggest problem is that the author has little spare time.</p>
<h1>Project Story</h1>
<p>Many years ago I made a GUI toolkit in pascal which had a line editor.
Some time later I made a state machine that could colorize pascal code 
(long before I knew of regexp).</p>
<p>Years later I wrote a simple text editor with folding in C++ which 
crashed every now and then. I got obsessed by the silly idea that I 
badly wanted a text editor capable of folding.</p>
<p>At some point I learned Ruby and the test first paradigm.
I wanted to write an editor in C++ and use Ruby as a scripting language.
And thus carefully investigated how to do embedding of Ruby.
One day I decided to write an editor prototype in Ruby and it turned out
to work with acceptable speed. It became AEditor version 0.x, a 
text editor capable of arbitrary folding.</p>
<p>Over the summer 2004 I wrote AEditor 1.x, which is the current version.
Featuring Ruby and C++ syntax coloring, theming and it operates in
entirely in GUI mode. It has 445 tests and 1518 assertions. Still im
far from satisfied with this version.</p>
<p>In the fall+winter of 2004 I have been analysing on what kind of
improvements I must make. Just before christmas I began making experiments
with these new ideas I have developed. Hopefully in the beginning of 2005
I can do an early release.</p>
<p>Even small editors requires some programming.</p>
