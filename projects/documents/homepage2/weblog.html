<h1>Weblog about editors and Ruby</h1>
<p>Hi, welcome to my blog, my name is Simon Strandgaard and I'm the 
author of <tt>AEditor</tt>. My age is 25 years and I'm studying 
mathematics and computer science. I usually chat on irc, logged in 
as <tt>neoneye</tt> on the <tt>#ruby-lang</tt> channel.
I have a small appartment in Copenhagen, the capital of Denmark.</p>

<h1>Textmate - 5 aug 2005</h1>
<p>5 months ago I did something very bad, with no regrets.
I replaced my noisy Gentoo Linux box with a noiseless Mac Mini. 
I began using <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a>,
and now no longer sees a need for good editor. This editor is
superior to any other editor I have tried in the past, its
the next generation GUI VI/emacs editors. It can be extended
in any possible way. Everything is so intuitive that even
non-programmers can do macros, commands, make changes to the
language files. IMHO <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a>
is the most wellcrafted editor ever made.</p>
<p>Recently I have switched from qwerty to the superior dvorak layout.
</p>


<h1>Obfuscated Ruby - 1 apr 2005</h1>
<p>I have written an <a href="http://iorcc.dyndns.org/2005/entries/IORCC-2005-03-28-01007-2">obfuscated piece</a>
of Ruby code for IORCC 2005, The International Obfuscation of Ruby Contest. 
I made a program that both compiles as C++ and can be interpreted by Ruby.

<h1>Cocoa Crazy - 20 mar 2005</h1>
<p>Today I have added scrollbars to my Cocoa Textcanvas (which I
want to interface with AEditor2). Its amazingly slow to do scrolling.</p>
<img src="data/textcanvas001.png" width="360" height="231" alt="AEditor for mac" />

<h1>Cocoa Crazy - 08 mar 2005</h1>
<p>Today I wrote my first Cocoa program. I figured that I needed a
nice <tt>IRB</tt> frontend for mac. This would be a good subject
to learn about cocoa.</p>
<img src="data/mac_irb1.png" width="224" height="192" alt="IRB for mac" />
<p>I got the frontend working relatively quickly. Now i'm investigating
how to get it connected with IRB. I suspect that I need to embed ruby into
objective C.</p>

<h1>I got my Big Mac - 02 mar 2005</h1>
<p>This Wensday I recieved my minimac. Now my desktop looks like this.
Right most on the floor you see my big old machine. Right most on the
table you see the mac mini. Left most on the table you see my lego model
I used to develop AEditors new data structure.</p>
<p>Recently I cleaned up my appartment, I carried 3 computers, 10 keyboards,
one 15" crt display, some boxes with stuff in down to my basement. When I 
cleaned up I managed to find a computer hidden under my bed which I totally 
had forgotten. The really amazing thing is that I also cleaned up some time ago, 
where I carried down 6 computers to my basement, plus 3 crt displays.
Now I'm confident that the huge computer on the picture is the only remaining
computer that I must carry down to the basement.</p>
<img src="data/neoneye_desktop.png" width="520" height="390" alt="macmini and display" />

<p>Below you see the lego model I used for building the new caching system 
for AEditor. The white pieces of paper with text on is actual text on a
line. The small yellow pieces of paper indicates the end of line state.
Whenever a line is modified then we flag it as dirty. Later when we need
to update the display, we run the lexer for the dirty lines. Depending on
the state we get back from the lexer, in case it corresponds to the next
line state, then we stop propagating. In case its different then we simply
flag the following line as dirty. The most tricky part is when you want
to insert or remove entire lines.</p>
<p>Don't worry if you don't understand what I said above. My point is only 
that I could not have though it out without lego and unittesting.</p>

<p>Below you see a cookie box. They didn't tasted that good, but they
had a cool name.</p>

<h1>A new view on things - 15 feb 2005</h1>
<p>I recieved the <tt>19" tft</tt> display last week, its a Samsung
SyncMaster 910T. I must say its wonderful to do my programming on.
I went crazy and also ordered a <b>mac mini</b>, lets hope it arrives soon.
I have big expectations to this small piece of machinary. My current
mechanic beast is big, noisy, slow, stoneage cisc architecture and ready 
to be thrown out.</p>

<p>Last monday I felt sick, pain in my brain and my nose running
all the time. I had to goto my job and the next day to the university
and wensday to the job again, even though I was sick. Thrusday I was
still sick, and had to go on a small ski vacation for 3 days, where I 
snowboarded the first 2 hours and afterwards switched to alpine ski 
(because I got beaten up too badly and because I was a little sick).
Anyway my sickness disappeared on the ski vacation and I'm now ready
to do some more programming again. Its impossible to serious coding
when you are in great pain.</p>


<h1>Things I did today - 01 feb 2005</h1>
<p>I have had my first day free from job in long time, so I have
been busy with solving all kind of issues (Things that I really
should have been doing ages ago). Im usually very bad at solving
realworld issues, because I'm sucked into a computer most of the time.</p>

<p>Someone tried to break in to my appartment this weekend, 
<b>apparently nothing got stolen</b>. Its impossible for me to tell if
any of the backup cds are gone <tt>:-(</tt>. With that whole in 
the window the temperature has been quite low inside. Today I 
have arranged to get the broken window fixed.</p>

<p>On the job we released our program yesterday (31 jan 2005), so
my colleagues wanted to be able to reach me no matter
where i am, in case the customer has problems with our product. 
I had a heavy cellphone ages ago, which I never used.
Today I have bought a cheap cellphone.</p>

<p>I have had these glasses for a long time, so long that they had
become ugly and twisted. Today I went to glass-specialist and got 
the glasses rewamped. They look and feels now as good as new.</li>

<p>Today I went to the university and bought all the books that 
I need for this course on the university. Plus I bought the
<b><tt>Programming Ruby</tt></b> second edition (and discovered that my
<tt>[<a href="http://metaeditor.sourceforge.net/embed/">ruby embedded into c++</a>]</tt> project was mentioned in it, exciting).</p>

<p>Today I have rearranged the furnitures and cleaned up my 
appartment, carried down <tt>3 monitors</tt> and <tt>6 computers</tt> 
to my basement. All the piles of A4 papers have been putted in bags 
and has been stored under my bed. My university assignments has been
put into a ringbinder.</p>

<p>In the appartment complex where I live, we are about to get
a cheap internet+phone+tv connection. Today I have been filling
out 3 formulars so that it can be installed at my place.</p>

<p>Today I talked in phone with the tax woman, attempting to figure
out how to solve a tax issue of mine. But I never really understood
this. Maybe I'm bad at money.</p>

<p>And today perhaps my <b><tt>19" tft display</tt></b> will arrive?</p>

<h1>AEditor 2.1 released - 19 jan 2005</h1>
<p>Yesterday I packed up 2.1, codename "megacorp". Since last
release I have only had very little sparetime, which I have 
spend on adding folding and bookmarks.</p>

<img src="aeditor_shots/045.png" width="443" height="383" alt="screenshot of version 2.1" />

<p>As you can see 14 keybindings so far. I still need to
add keybindings for pageup/pagedown, search, replace.
There is no smart HOME behavior (I have been thinking of
also adding a smart END behavior, that toggles between
the end of the text and the end of the line).</p>

<img src="data/multi_color_font_01.png" width="262" height="102" 
alt="example of a multicolor font" />

<p>Lothar Scholz asked me about multicolor fonts, how I wanted
to use them in the editor (Yes, this is indeed something I want).
I spend 80% of my awake time in front of some kind of editor,
its so sad to look on mono fonts. I want to look at something
nice (other times I want to look at good old amiga demo/game fonts).
This will require that I make my own font editor and my own
file format for storing these fonts. Alternatively I could make
the fonts as SVG, so they would be scalable.</p>


<h1>AEditor 2.0 released - 03 jan 2005</h1>
<p>Earlier today I suddenly had gotten vertical and horizontal
scrolling working. I decided to see if I could add enough 
features to it today so it would become able to release.
I added load, save, exit, home, end, and wrote some default
text in case there is no filename supplied. I fullfilled my
goal and released it to the wild [<a href="http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/2443/aeditor-2.0.tar.gz">download</a>].</p>

<img src="aeditor_shots/044.png" width="389" height="275" alt="screenshot of version 2.0" />

<p>The <tt>ruvi</tt> author (Alexander Kellett) would like to write 
a vi interface for aeditor. But he has some demands first. 
A persistent undo system which keeps its tree structure 
(so no undo info is discarded). I think I will aim towards adding
this at some point.</p>

<p>Next I will be looking into enhancing aeditor with folding,
more editing strategies, eventually add templates.
First I add features which is new to me.
Afterwards I can add all the features that I'm already 
familiarized myself with: syntax coloring, undo/redo, macroes.</p>

<h1>Happy New Year - 02 jan 2005</h1>
<p>Just before christmas I decided to begin from scratch again.
After doing lots of analysis during the fall of 2004, I now
feel that I'm ready to try out my new ideas. While it has been
christmas I have implemented a new datastructure that is 
superior to earlier editor datastructures of mine. Its faster,
its unicode and much more robust. I have switched from using 
Ruby's native <tt>curses</tt> package, to making my own wrapper 
for <tt>libncursesw</tt>. This enables me to render text as 
<tt>UTF-8</tt>. I am fairly satisfied with the new model.</p>

<p>The view is still very early, it supports insert and backspace.
I got suprised today that I were able to reduce the code for
these 2 operations, so things almost happens automagicly.
Both operations are just a simple <tt>model.replace</tt>.
</p>

<p>I got this xmas present from my sister. Thanks.</p>
