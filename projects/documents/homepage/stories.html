<p>"AEditor is a free source code editing component 
implemented in Ruby."<br>
<i>Quoted from scintillarelated (10 September 2003)</i>.

<p>"Negotiating Ruby's Internals<br>
I must say: there's been some excellent 
work of late to further expose the usefulness 
of Ruby's API. I don't favor C++ development, 
but I found Simon Strandgaard's Ruby Embedded 
into C++ tutorial to be more than a tutorial. 
The best part for me is the sheer number of 
obscure links he's collected. You follow links 
in and out of explanations and code examples 
from across the Web. Better still, if you 
use C++, you'll get plenty of good instruction 
here."<br>

"I think this is a very good idea. Especially 
if it presented a higher-level interface than 
scintilla's -- one that is more oriented towards 
high-level editing/code-assist/refactoring 
operations. This would be even more attractive 
if/when we someone makes an Aeditor plugin that 
can act as an alternative/replacement for scintilla.<br>

<tt>&lt;neoneye&gt;</tt> good dinner<br>
<tt>&lt;batsman&gt;</tt> neoneye: I pointed hal9000_ to your regexp-engine yesterday; I've been browsing the code & must say that it looks like one of those cool things that unfortunately very few people know about :-|<br>

<tt>&lt;daft&gt;</tt> i'll check it out today or tomorrow :)<br>
<tt>&lt;daft&gt;</tt> it's always interesting to play with something written in ruby ;)<br>
<tt>&lt;neoneye&gt;</tt> daft: the source code for the editor only takes up 3341 lines of ruby code<br>
<tt>&lt;daft&gt;</tt> good job<br>
<tt>&lt;neoneye&gt;</tt> daft: what platform are you on?  linux<br>
<tt>&lt;daft&gt;</tt> i was impressed by your regexp engine ;)<br>
<tt>&lt;daft&gt;</tt> yep<br>
<tt>&lt;neoneye&gt;</tt> daft: it works on my linux box.. so I hope it works on yours too<br>
<tt>&lt;neoneye&gt;</tt> daft: thanks for remembering regexp<br>
<tt>&lt;daft&gt;</tt> it was too cool to play with it online to forget :)<br>
<tt>&lt;daft&gt;</tt> very nice idea<br>

<tt>&lt;batsman&gt;</tt> frankly, I find aeditor much more interesting than FreeRIDE<br>
<tt>&lt;batsman&gt;</tt> I'm more concerned about editors than IDEs
