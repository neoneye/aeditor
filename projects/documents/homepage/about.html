<h2>What is this project about?</h2>
<p>Pair-programming can be unnecessary confusing, without a good editor.
Its difficult to keep an overview when your not sitting at the keyboard. 
When hitting pageup/down the observer quickly looses his bearings. 
What is needed is animation, scrolling, folding and assistence with refactoring.
</p>

<p>Please take your time, and write a message in my guestbook,

Or if you dare then visit my 
<a href="neoneye/">homepage</a>.

<h2>Implementation plan</h2>
<ul>
	<li>use FreeBSD license.</li>
	<li>write backend in Ruby to obtain flexibility and robustness.</li>
	<li>write widget-frontends in C++ to obtain speed.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Experimental goals</h2>
<ul>
	<li>experiments with animated operations. Will this
	reduce the observers confusion?</li>
	<li>dual-screen experiments. How does it work out if one is
	writing code and the other one is writing comments?
	What if you can hand over the keyboard to the observer, just
	by pressing F12, so that you become the observer?</li>
	<li>improve user experience.. HCI + contextual design.</li>
</ul>
