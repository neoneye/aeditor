you can use your good old amiga-bitmap fonts ;-)

<hr />
During assember coding, hiliting of HOW efficient (well-paired) your code is,

sentence, etc. If you swtich to a mode (using F#-key) then all your actions 
acted accordingly. For example, in word mode, if you hit delete it would 
delete the work you were on. You get the idea.
