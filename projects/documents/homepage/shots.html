This is the Fox/FXRuby frontend for AEditor anno 2004. It demonstrates 
ruby syntax coloring. You will need to fetch the <tt>aeditor-1.x</tt> 
branch in order to try it out. Still a few features from the <tt>0.x</tt>
branch needs to be imported into this branch.

easily gain an overview of the different parts it consists of.
In order to try it out you must fetch the <tt>aeditor-0.x</tt> branch.

This is the QT experimental frontend for AEditor. It shows how 
textures could be used in order to get a nice visual appealing interface.
QT has a nice API, but it requires an extra annoying compilation step (moc).
I don't know if I will continue it.

Early prototype for MSDOS anno 1999. It was good at visualing the buffer, 
but really poor at editing. Making a suitable datastructure which allows
for editing is extremely hard. Don't let this fool you. It was able to do 
folding, wordwrap and syntaxhiliting. This prototype was'nt able to do 
any serious editing!
