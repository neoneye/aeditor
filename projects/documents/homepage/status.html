<h2>What am I doing right now ?</h2>
<p>At the moment I am experimenting with many things,
which hopefully will find its way into the core of AEditor.
</p>
<ol>
<li><tt>Apr-2004</tt>
Finally I got the regexp engine right. I have released both
version 0.8 and version 0.9. It now passes 96.66 % of the 
rubicon tests.
<li><tt>Mar-2004</tt>
I have been working on a <a href="http://neoneye.dk/rubybook/">book about Ruby</a> 
for the last month. Yes, Im still looking at regexp. 
<li><tt>Feb-2004</tt>
Looking at nested regexp's, this stuff is complex I must admit.
<li><tt>Jan-2004</tt>
Still looking at regexp. I have made a new design, which should
allow for nested expressions and better backtracking. 
<li><tt>Dec-2003</tt>
regexp-engine version 0.7, passes 92.5 % of the rubicon testcases (quite good I would say).
Mark Sparshatt has initiated working on perl6 regexp-compatibility.
At the moment I focus on optimization and bugfixing.
<li><tt>Nov-2003</tt> 
<a href="http://rubyforge.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs/cgi/viewcvs.cgi/projects/regexp_engine/?cvsroot=aeditor">regex engine</a>
can now do the fundemental operations.</li>

<h2>Iteration 3 - Usable</h2>
<p>Many editing operations is working. Still regex is missing.
Goal for me is to glue the editor-backend (Ruby) together with 
the frontends (C++).</p>
<p>The AEditor-backend is written in Ruby, where
I use test-first development. Status at this very moment is:
<tt>403 tests, 1407 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors</tt>.
I have never used TDD in such big scale, it really rocks.
Lack of unit-testing was a major problem with earlier iterations 
of this project, things were hard(impossible) to debug.
There is a screenshot of the Ncurses frontend
[<a href="aeditor_shots/004.png">here</a>].
</p>
<p>The Fox-AEditor-frontend is written in C++, and is at
a very early stage. I hope to embed this widget into 
FreeRIDE some day.
</p>
<p>I am conducting some experiments with embedding
[<a href="ruby_cplusplus/index.html">ruby into c++</a>].
Which I use for the GUI-widgets (Fox, GTK, QT, OpenGL).
</p>
<p>The current top-entries in my todo-list says; 
Implement markers.  
Make the Fox-widget usable.

<h2>Iteration 2 - Prototype</h2>
<p>The primary goal was to make editing possible, which I
achieved. It has a very flexible editing engine which 
supports folding, wordwrap, symbols, markers. It has a
seperate ncurses frontend. The overall design is clean.
Unfortunatly did blocking not fit into this design, which send
me back to the drawing board. Thus iteration 2 is paused!
Iteration 3 has become so good that Iteration 2 is completely dead.</p>


<h2>Iteration 1 - Prototype</h2>
<p>This only worked with BorlandC31 (MSDOS only). It was
capable of: line-folding, scope-folding, wordwrap, hiliting,
undo/redo. I had unfortunatly underestimated the need
for editing, so it has only very limited editing capabilities.
Its design was flawed, masochistic, inflexible and non-scalable.</p>
