1. Overview

This project serves as an "simple" example on how to embed
ruby into c++. Your can freely use this as a skeleton for 
your own projects, No need to mention my name :-)

Requirements:
Ruby-1.8.0

The homepage of this tutorial is:
http://aeditor.rubyforge.org/ruby_cplusplus/index.html


2. Building

This procedure should hopefully result in some executables.
If you experience any trouble, then please mail me :-)

	./configure
	make


3. Executing

In order to run the executables you will need to do this:

	cd source
	./test

If you see a line containing 'bingo', then you will know
that everything is working (c++ interacting with Ruby).
It is now up to you to study the output, compare it to the 
print statements in the source.


4. Reconfigure

In order to reconfigure you will need to execute:
	./source/wrap.sh
	./autogen.sh

This requires
SWIG-1.3.19
autoconf-2.53 (which includes autoheader)
automake-1.5


5. Feedback

This should get you going with embedding ruby into c++.
If you have any questions, thoughts, suggestions.. then
mail me :-)
