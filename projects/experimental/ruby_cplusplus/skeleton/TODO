*	init_stack() must be investigated further.

*	Shared library. lazy loading of the ruby-library.

*	add rule to Makefile.am so that the *.i files 
	can be SWIG'ed automaticly

*	hide signals.. move signal handling from main.cpp 
	into library.cpp.

*	Capture all ruby-output. Maybe behave like an 
	iostream?

*	the "-rdynamic" option for g++, so that we can 
	require 'stringio'

*	Windows makefiles.


People that want notify on version 0.4.
