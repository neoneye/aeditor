version 0.3, 20-Sep-2003
*	renamed everything (attempt to make things more intuitive):
	'insert' -> 'execute'
	'repaint' -> 'callback'
	'View' -> 'ExampleBridgeCpp'
	'Impl' -> 'ExampleBridgeCppImpl'
	'Redirect' -> 'ExampleBridgeRuby'
	'RUBY_CPP' -> 'NAMESPACE_RUBY'
	'EMBEDRUBY' -> 'NAMESPACE_LIBRARY'
	'RubyError' -> 'Error'
	'ViewQt' -> 'ExampleCpp'
	'RubyView' -> 'ExampleRuby'
	'redirect.h' -> 'example_bridge_ruby.h'
	'redirect.cpp' -> 'example_bridge_ruby.cpp'
	'redirect.i' -> 'example_bridge_ruby_wrap.i'
	'Embed' -> 'Wrapper'

*	removed the manual setup stuff, so that only the
	example of how to use SWIG is there (simplifies things).

*	moved AEditor from sourceforge.net to rubyforge.org.

*	using rb_path2class(klass_name) instead of
	rb_const_get(rb_cObject, rb_intern(klass_name)).


version 0.2, 17-Apr-2003
*	"RubyView" can now inheirit from "Redirect".
	This hasn't been possible before, so instead I used
	an ugly workaround. Thanks to "Steve Hart" for this.
	Apparently there is a difference on how you 
	intantiate ruby-things inside c++. This difference
	is a SWIG problem and should be solved in 3.1.20.

*	autoconf detects automaticly where ruby is located.
	you no longer need to specify 
	./configure --with-ruby=/mylongpathtoruby

*	ruby_script("embed"); has been added. It assigns a
	name to the $0 variable, so we can test where or not
	our ruby files is being executed from c++.

version 0.1, 04-Apr-2003
*	initial version
