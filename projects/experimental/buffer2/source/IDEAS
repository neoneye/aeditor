<lypanov> neoneye: idea for aeditor: split window, select text in both sides, show diff
<neoneye> lypanov: good idea
<neoneye> lypanov: I had a look on winmerge.. a side-by-side diff for windows.. which can do syntax coloring..
<lypanov> neoneye: another one: % isn't that good in vim. i think *much* more can be done easily
<neoneye> lypanov: kind of the same would be nice
<lypanov> neoneye: look at kde's diff program - kompare2  sometime. its very good
<neoneye> lypanov: whats wrong with vims parentesis matching?
<lypanov> neoneye: e.g, i'd like a way of selecting the current function, and then moving around
<lypanov> neoneye: begin / end, while / end etc, should all be matchable
<neoneye> true
<neoneye> good idea
