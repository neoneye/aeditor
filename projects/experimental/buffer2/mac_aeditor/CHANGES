*	I had forgotten a 'break' in the dispatch switch, causing
	the newline case to behave weird. Fixed.
*	Investigated if letter/line spacing really used
	2pixel increments (which was wrong). But it used
	1pixel increments as it were supposed to.
*	on startup we now scroll to the cursor area.
*	I am more used to having origo in the top/left corner, so
	I have flipped the y scale. But this had impact on how
	the drawInRect rendered the glyphs in the first row..
	now the first row looks extremely ugly.

*	rough scrolling is now working when moving the caret.
*	splitline is now roughly working.
*	figured out why the first letter in the line didn't got
	rendered (it was because of negative value in unsigned int).

*	optimized rendering is now working with arbitrary fonts.
*	got the topmost line aligned with the top-bound.
*	added sliders to adjust linespacing and letterspacing.
*	glyphs are now centered within their cell(s).
*	apple+ increases the fontsize.. and apple- decreases.
*	previously text could only be rendered with white color.
	now we can render with colors!

*	added a "refresh" button that forces a complete repaint.
*	do statistics on time spend on rendering each line.
*	added a popup that lets you choose the rendering algorithm.
