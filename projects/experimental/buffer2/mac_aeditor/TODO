backspace of the last letter in the file.. isn't working.


Cocoa's drawInRect seems to behave odd when y is negative.
It appears as if the first row of text is rendered on a wrong line (ugly).
If this is what I think it is.. then I may have more luck using
drawAtPoint.


clean up calculation of position.x to pixel.x,
and calculation of position.y to pixel.y.
(so that scrollToCaret can use same offsets as the render code).


selections.


support for multicolor fonts. Eventually with
a fallback font for non-ascii glyphs. 


caching of the rendered lines, because
rendering is very slow.


canvas background effects such as:
* transparency.
* blur.
* images.
