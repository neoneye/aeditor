What needs to be done:

*	'end' statements isn't detected correct. I (Simon) has
	only little insight how the original 'coverage.rb' works.
	I don't know how to accomplish this. Please contribute
	in case you know it.

*	Have a Look at 'profiler.rb', how does it count which
	pieces of code that has be executed.
	When we have this information available, then produce
	some nice HTML, so that you can browse that information.

*	nicer html output.
