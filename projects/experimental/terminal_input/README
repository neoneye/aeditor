WATCH OUT
*  CTRL-ALT-BACKSPACE will log you out, don't try it!!!

TODO LIST

*	wide char support in Ncurses, how ?
	Ncurses.getch() is there a wide version of it?
	how about output functions ?
	Is it UTF-8 or UCS-4 ?
	KeyEvent#text should yield an unicode string
	"xterm -u8" starts a terminal in UTF-8 mode,
	getch will then recieve UTF-8 sequences.

*	the danish letters %w(æ ø å Æ Ø Å) should be dealt with.

*	perhaps make both a termcap for ascii and for unicode ?

*	also make a termcap based on info from terminfo.

*	translate resize event into ResizeEvent.new(x, y)

*	deal with non-ascii, where value > 127

*	hash key-code 2 key-name

*	on my XTerm I entered a special escape mode, where
	LEFT yielded "\e0D"
	normaly I expect "\e[D"... why zero instead of bracket ?


Reading the keyboard is difficult through a unix-terminal.
Ncurses+Curses doesn't help you.


What I need is:
read keyboard sequences, like SHIFT+ARROW_UP and CTRL+ARROW_LEFT.


How do I do it ?

It seems to be possible to parse the raw-codes directly
from the keyboard. 



virtual keycodes, how should I organize them ?

I want to be able to capture a wide range of events:
   CTRL-SHIFT-LEFT
   SHIFT-TAB
   ALT-I
   CTRL-S
   WIN_RESIZE
   WIN_ICONIFY
   WIN_LOST_FOCUS

Also I want to capture press/release of arrow-keys,
so that I can do diagonal scrolling.

perhaps add support for #composite? which tell if the
glyph can combine with the following key.
example accent can combine with 'e' -> 'è'
