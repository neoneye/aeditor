TODO
*	get mouse input
	*	blocking on/off.

*	smooth scrolling!

*	some of the glyphs is 'higher' than cell_height.. why?
	Is the value I get from font->getFontHeight(); screwed ?
	If I don't fix it then it will cause rendering fuckups.

*	reduce amount of repaint. When moving the cursor around
	I invoke update(); which re-paints everything.
	This of cause has to be optimized, so only the dirty
	area get repainted.

*	resize the same way as GVIM, in steps equal to the
	font size so that we won't have any partial cells.

*	render decorations (markers)

*	animated folding!

*	properties so you dynamically can change
	configuration of the widget.  
	font, colors, textures.

*	flashing cursor.

*	unicode font rendering
	Damn!!  Fox doesn't yet support unicode!



THOUGHTS
*	FXText is dealing with resize in a completly 
	different fashion. I cannot figure out what
	is going on. Is FXText#resize approach better
	than the current one ?    I don't know.

CHANGES
13-sep-2003
*	focus in/out, behaved strange.
	if I pressed arrow_up then the widget lost focus.
	if I pressed arrow_down then we still got focus.
	How could the widget keep its focus ?
	Well very simple actually, in the onKeyPress I 
	returned '0', which means that the keypress were
	unhandled. By returning '1' I can tell Fox that
	the keystroke has been consumed by me.
*	get keyinput.
*	movement of cursor.
*	place the cursor when clicking.

12-sep-2003
*	find greatest background-style span and fillRect it.
*	widget resize (SEL_CONFIGURE).
*	render cursor.
*	experiments with gaining/loosing focus.
*	output which keys has been pressed.
