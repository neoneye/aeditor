  be sure that 'fxruby' gets installed.

Lets check that this program are working as its supposed to.

    fox toolkit      "1.0.43"
    fxruby           "1.0.25"

  other info:
    platform         "windows"

If you don't get similar output, then you maybe
hasn't installed the dependencies correct.

You may now start the program

  C:\somewhere> aeditor


You must copy the 'config_neoneye' file into your homedir
and name that file '.aeditor', otherwise no syntax coloring!
I don't know much about where the homedir are on windows.
If you know more about this than I then please help me make
this paragraph more clear.  Thanks.

Installation Guide (MacOSX)
===================================

If you use DarwinPorts or Fink there is only 2 dependencies
  install FXRuby-1.0.x
  install Iterator (last entry on the following list)

If you don't use DarwinPorts nor Fink to install fxruby, it 
can be difficult to get the dependencies installed.
We spend quite some time attempting to manually install
things.. and it took a whole day. Use DarwinPorts or Fink
if possible.

  dependency#1  Apple Developer Toolkit
  it contains gcc + friends.
  
  dependency#2  X11 sdk
  fox can only compile if it can access X11's header files.

  dependency#3  Lyle Johnsons OSX patch for Fox
  http://www.fifthplanet.net/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?Mac_OS_X

  dependency#4  Fox toolkit 1.0.x
  http://www.fox-toolkit.org/download.html
  WARNING: before invoking make, you must apply 
  Lyle Johnson's libtool patch. Otherwise it refuses to
  link in the end. (fox takes long time to compile)
  If fox cannot locate X11, then you may try to setup
  these environment variables
  CPATH=/usr/X11R6/include
  LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/X11R6/lib
  Be sure to compile Fox as a static library, otherwise
  it result in big slowdowns.

  dependency#5  Ruby 1.8.1
  http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=30&release_id=222
  
  dependency#6  FXRuby 1.0.x
  http://fxruby.sourceforge.net/

  dependency#7  Iterator 0.8 or better
  http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=18&release_id=512


WARNING: Mac has a low stacksize limit, you must increase the
stacksize so that AEditor is able to run. If you experience
StackSize error's then it is probably because of a too low
setting.           promt$  limit stacksize 8192
Above command should make this problem go away.
